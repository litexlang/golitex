Subject: Introduction to Litex - A Set-Theory-Based Formal Language for Euclidean Geometry

Dear Mmurphy,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently read your paper on autoformalizing Euclidean geometry using neuro-symbolic frameworks, and I found it very interesting and relevant to my own work.

I am Jiachen Shen from Shanghai AI Lab, and I am the creator of **Litex** (https://litexlang.com), a formal language that also focuses on formalizing mathematics, including Euclidean geometry examples. I would like to introduce Litex to you, as I believe it offers a complementary perspective to Lean-based approaches.

**Key Features of Litex:**

- **Set-theory foundation**: Unlike Lean, which is based on type theory, Litex is built on set theory, making it significantly more intuitive and easier to learn for mathematicians and students
- **User-friendly design**: While this comes at the cost of a larger kernel (which I've invested significant effort into), the trade-off results in a much simpler user experience
- **Euclidean geometry support**: Litex includes comprehensive examples and support for formalizing Euclidean geometry problems (https://litexlang.com/doc/Examples/Hilbert_geometry_axioms_formalization)

Given your work on autoformalization in Euclidean geometry, I believe Litex's set-theory-based approach and intuitive syntax could be particularly valuable for your research, especially in making formalization more accessible to users who may find type-theory-based systems challenging.

**Community Recognition:**
- 600+ GitHub stars
- Featured in Hacker News top 10
- Covered by 机器之心 (Machine Heart) in their SOTA introduction

I would be happy to discuss how Litex might complement your autoformalization framework, or explore potential collaborations. If you're interested in learning more about Litex, please feel free to visit our website (https://litexlang.com) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/litexlang/golitex). I would be delighted to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you might have.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. Star the Litex github repository if you like Litex!

Best regards,
Jiachen Shen
