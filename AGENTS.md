# Repository working agreements

## Local-only scripts workspace

The entire `scripts/` directory directly under this repository root is local-only.
Nothing under it may be added, committed, or pushed in the parent golitex
repository or published through its GitHub tree. There are no file or subtree
exceptions. Never use `git add -f` to bypass this rule.

Keep `/scripts/` ignored. Remove any accidentally tracked scripts paths from
parent-repository tracking; preserve local source files unless the user explicitly
asks to delete them. Preserve existing nested repositories and their histories.

Publish requested deliverables in the appropriate public directories, such as
`textbooks/`, `examples/`, `docs/`, or `showcases/`; do not expose the local
scripts workspace itself.
