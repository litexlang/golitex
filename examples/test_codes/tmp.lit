# Numeric equality: 1 + 1 and 2 are different symbols, but equal
1 + 1 = 2

# Variable equality: 20 * x and y + z are different symbols, but equal
have x R
have y R = 3 * x
have z R = 17 * x
20 * x = 3 * x + 17 * x = y + z

# Function equality: f(a) and g(b) are different symbols, but equal
have fn f(a R) R = a
have fn g(a R) R = f(a)
have a R
have b R = a
f(a) = g(b)
