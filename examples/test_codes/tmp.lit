    forall total_people, front_people, back_people, position_hua R:
        front_people = 3 / 5 * total_people
        back_people = 1 / 3 * total_people
        front_people + back_people + 1 = total_people
        position_hua = front_people + 1
        =>:
            position_hua = 10
    prove:
        front_people = 3 / 5 * total_people
        back_people = 1 / 3 * total_people
        front_people + back_people + 1 = total_people
        (3/5)*total_people + (1/3)*total_people + 1 = total_people
        (9/15)*total_people + (5/15)*total_people + 1 = total_people
        (14/15)*total_people + 1 = total_people
        1 = total_people - (14/15)*total_people
        1 = (1/15)*total_people
        1 * 15 = 1 * total_people = 15
        front_people = 3 / 5 * 15 = 9
        position_hua = front_people + 1 = 10
