# new_pipeline statement execution

## Hard rule: only `exec_stmt`

```text
Runners / REPL / tests / other modules  →  Runtime::exec_stmt ONLY
exec_xxx_stmt / execute_fact_statement  →  only called from inside execute,
                                           by exec_stmt
```

Never call branch `exec_*_stmt` functions from outside
`crate::new_pipeline::execute`. Nested proof/WD uses `verify_*` / `store_*`,
not another `exec_stmt`.

## Result shape

```text
ExecStmtResult                    // stmt-kind dispatch only
  Fact(ExecFactStmtResult)
  Definition(ExecDefinitionStmtResult)
  Unsafe(ExecUnsafeStmtResult)

Leaf *Result = Success(*SuccessResult) | Failed(...)
  (AbstractProp has only SuccessResult; no soft-fail path yet)

is_failed() on ExecStmtResult walks into the leaf.
  Failed  → discard temp; session continues
  Success → merge temp → parent
RuntimeResult::Err               // SessionError; stop session
```

Leaf Success/Fail types live at the head of each statement file;
`exec_stmt_result.rs` keeps only the top-level dispatch shells.

JSON presentation (not Rust names): Success → `"success"`, Failed → `"error"`,
SessionError → `"session_error"`.

## Transactional `exec_stmt`

```text
exec_stmt (pub only)
  push empty temp ExecEnv
    exec_xxx_stmt  (execute-module private; writes current top only)
  pop temp
    is_failed  → Ok(result); no merge
    else       → parent.merge_from(temp) → Ok(result)
Err → merge/invariant bugs (SessionError)
```

- Success does not carry the closed temp env.
- Binder locals (forall / prop params) are inner scopes inside the temp shell.
