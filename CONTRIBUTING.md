# Contributing to Litex

Making formal reasoning simple, stupid to everyone, everyAI is our core mission. We warmly welcome anyone with similar passion to contribute to Litex.

The followings are main tasks that we sincerely welcome contributions for. We will try our best to support all of contributors financially:

## 1. Improve the Litex standard library

The Litex standard library is under active development. A rich standard library is essential for the success of Litex. Visit [std](https://github.com/litexlang/std) for more details.

## 2. Improve the Litex kernel

The Litex kernel is under active development. Currently, Litex is not fully open-sourced. If you want to contribute to the Litex kernel, please contact us through email: litexlang@outlook.com.

## 3. Formalize a math textbook

Formalizing a math textbook successfully, no matter it is a high school math textbook or a college math textbook, is a significant milestone for Litex. This can show the power and potential of Litex. We are now trying to formalize Terrence Tao's "Analysis I" and "Analysis II". 

## 4. Develop a Litex-based AI system

Formal languages are valuable across the three major pillars of deep learning—**data, algorithms, and computation**.

* **Data:** Formalized data is especially valuable. Large models trained on formal corpora show significantly improved reasoning ability.
* **Algorithms:** Formal languages enable large models to *self-improve* their reasoning. A model can generate its own math problems, solve them, and verify the solutions, forming a fully automated pipeline. This makes it possible to use reinforcement learning to autonomously learn mathematical reasoning, similar to AlphaGo’s self-play training.
* **Computation:** During inference, formal languages make it possible to detect reasoning errors in real time, reducing unnecessary computation.

Anyone interested in any of the tasks is warmly welcome to contact us through email: litexlang@outlook.com.
