# Contributing to Litex

Making formal reasoning simple, stupid to everyone, everyAI is our core mission. We warmly welcome anyone with similar passion to contribute to Litex.

The followings are main tasks that we sincerely welcome contributions for. We will try our best to support all of contributors financially:

## 1. Improve the Litex kernel

The Litex [kernel](https://github.com/litexlang/golitex) is for the time being developed by ONE MAN, Jiachen Shen, the founder of Litex. This is a big challenge for him. We are recruiting contributors with good taste of math and great skills of programming to help him.

Currently, Litex is not fully open-sourced. If you want to contribute to the Litex kernel, please contact us through email: litexlang@outlook.com.

## 2. Litex standard library (std)

A standard library is a collection of reusable code that provides a common set of functionality for a computer language. It is a crucial component of any programming language because it allows developers to reuse code, which can save time and effort. Since Litex is a new programming language, we need to develop a standard library for it, covering everything from basic math operations to advanced college math knowledge. Visit [std](https://github.com/litexlang/std) for more details.

## 3. Formalize math textbooks

Formalizing a math textbook successfully, no matter it is a high school math textbook or a college math textbook, is a significant milestone for Litex. This can show the power and potential of Litex. We are now trying to formalize Terrence Tao's "Analysis I" and "Analysis II". 

## 4. Formalize math datasets

There are many mathematics datasets in the AI community, including well-known ones such as the [MATH dataset](https://github.com/hendrycks/math), [GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math), and [minif2f](https://github.com/openai/miniF2F). Formalizing these datasets in Litex would enable AI training directly on Litex. Visit our huggingface space [here](https://huggingface.co/litexlang) for more details.

## 5. Develop a Litex-based AI system

Formal languages are valuable across the three major pillars of deep learning—**data, algorithms, and computation**.

* **Data:** Formalized data is especially valuable. Large models trained on formal corpora show significantly improved reasoning ability.
* **Algorithms:** Formal languages enable large models to *self-improve* their reasoning. A model can generate its own math problems, solve them, and verify the solutions, forming a fully automated pipeline. This makes it possible to use reinforcement learning to autonomously learn mathematical reasoning, similar to AlphaGo’s self-play training.
* **Computation:** During inference, formal languages make it possible to detect reasoning errors in real time, reducing unnecessary computation.

## 6. Litex documentation

Good documentation plays a critical role in the development and usability of any computer language. It not only helps users understand how to use the language effectively but also ensures long-term maintainability and collaboration.

Litex is a powerful framework, and its ecosystem spans many fields including AI, mathematics, and more. Because of this wide scope and rapid growth, it needs well-organized and continuously updated documentation that can evolve alongside new features. That’s why we need the support of community contributors to help improve and expand the documentation together.

## 7. Sponsor Litex

Litex is a free and open-source project. We are sincerely grateful to anyone who is willing to sponsor Litex. With your support, we can better serve the user community and reward the contributors. We might even be able to try more innovative ideas to make Litex even better.

## 8. Join Litex community
